A simple Lisp interpreter for Java. It is heavily inspired by amake/TinyLisp, with additional features:

* JSON representation, which makes it ready for visualization
* A simple debugger to trace every step of the evaluation
* Compact formatting to one line
* Reactive playground
* Good enough performance, comparing to SpEL or Groovy
* 75+ Built-in functions for math, text and date-time handling
* Null safety for all built-in functions
